This crate provides APIs to allow for efficient implementations of operation and log stores. These
persistence and query APIs are utilised by higher-level components of the p2panda stack, such
as `p2panda-sync` and `p2panda-stream`. 

An in-memory storage solution is provided in the form of a `MemoryStore` which implements both the
`OperationStore` and `LogStore` traits.
