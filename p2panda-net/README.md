This crate provides a data-type-agnostic p2p networking layer offering robust, direct communication
to any device, no matter where they are.

It provides a stream-based API for higher layers: Applications subscribe to any "topic" they are
interested in and `p2panda-net` will automatically discover similar peers and transport raw bytes
between them.

Additionally `p2panda-net` can be extended with custom sync protocols for all data types, allowing
applications to "catch up on past data", eventually converging to the same state.

Most of the lower-level networking of `p2panda-net` is made possible by the work of
[iroh](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/) utilising well-established and known standards, like
QUIC for transport, (self-certified) TLS for transport encryption, STUN for establishing direct
connections between devices, Tailscale's DERP (Designated Encrypted Relay for Packets) for relay
fallbacks, PlumTree and HyParView for broadcast-based gossip overlays.
