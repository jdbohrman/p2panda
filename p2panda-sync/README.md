This crate provides a data- and transport-agnostic interface to implement custom sync protocols,
compatible with `p2panda-net` or other peer-to-peer networking solutions.

In addition to the generic definition of the `SyncProtocol` trait, `p2panda-sync` includes
optional implementations for efficient sync of append-only log-based data types. These optional
implementations may be activated via feature flags. Finally, `p2panda-sync` provides helpers to
encode wire messages in CBOR.

## Features

- Transport- and data-type agnostic trait definitions compatible with `p2panda-net`
- Efficient and ready-to-use implementation for log-height based sync of p2panda core data-types
- Privacy-first design allowing implementations to reveal as little information as possible during handshake phase
- Generic design to re-use the same sync protocol for very different applications
